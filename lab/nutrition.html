          <div class="content">
            Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way
            of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses
            food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a
            lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big
            results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.
